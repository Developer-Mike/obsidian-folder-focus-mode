## Obsidian Folder Focus Mode Plugin

Adds an option to folder's context menu, which allows to focus file explorer on chosen folder and its files and subdirectories, while hiding all the other elements.

In order to disable this mode, you have to use a global command 'Disable folder focus mode' or open context menu for previously chosen folder and choose 'Unfocus'.

Plugin is a quick draft, as I really needed this function. I strongly recommend joining and developing it with me to make it even more useful ðŸŒš.

#### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-folder-focus-mode/`.

#### Development

- Clone this repo.
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.
